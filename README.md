FLEE lab plate reader data preparation for analysis
Notes: 
Data needs to be in separate folders, each excel file name corresponds to the sample name. Different folders represend different measurement (&sample) dates.
If a calibration curve is to be used, this calculation must be alread done on each excel sheet. Otherwise, same code can be used on raw data as well (with different cell ranges for each read_ function. )
