\title{Perform Pairwise Comparisons of Estimated Marginal Means by Position and Day}
\usage{
position_comparison(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{lmerMod} or any other model object that is
compatible with the \code{emmeans} function. This model should include \code{day}
and \code{position} as factors.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of the pairwise comparisons,
including the estimated differences, standard errors, test statistics,
p-values, and confidence intervals. The comparisons are adjusted using
Tukey's method to control for multiple comparisons.
}
\description{
The \code{position_comparison} function performs pairwise comparisons of estimated
marginal means (EMMs) for different positions, grouped by day, using a
specified model. This function is useful for post-hoc analysis to determine
significant differences between positions within each day.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Computes the estimated marginal means (EMMs) for the \code{position} factor,
grouped by the \code{day} factor, using the \code{emmeans} function.
\item Performs pairwise comparisons of the EMMs using the \code{contrast} function
with Tukey's adjustment for multiple comparisons.
\item Returns the results of the pairwise comparisons.
}
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'my_model' is a fitted model object
results <- position_comparison(my_model)
print(results)
