\title{Fit a Linear Mixed-Effects Model with Flexible Input}
\usage{
experiment_lmer(response_col, y, fixed_factor, random_factor, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{response_col}{A numeric vector or column from the data representing the response variable (e.g., \code{xyl_gly.median}).}

\item{y}{A factor or numeric column from the data representing the main fixed effect (e.g., \code{day}).}

\item{fixed_factor}{A factor or numeric column representing an additional fixed effect for interaction (e.g., \code{position}).}

\item{random_factor}{A factor or grouping variable representing the random effect (e.g., \code{chainID}).}

\item{data}{A data frame or data.table containing the variables in the model.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{lmerMod} object, which contains the results of the linear mixed-effects model.
}
\description{
This function fits a linear mixed-effects model using the \code{lmer} function from the \code{lme4} package. It allows for flexible specification of the response variable, fixed effect, random effect, and interaction terms. The formula is dynamically generated based on the provided inputs.
}
\details{
The function constructs a formula dynamically in the form of \code{response ~ y * fixed_factor + (1 | random_factor)}, where the interaction between \code{y} and \code{fixed_factor} is included in the fixed effects, and the random effect is specified with \code{random_factor}.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have a data.table called ER_data with columns 'xyl_gly.median', 'day', 'position', and 'chainID':
fit <- experiment_lmer(xyl_gly.median, day, fixed_factor = position, random_factor = chainID, data = ER_data)
summary(fit)
