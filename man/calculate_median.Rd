\title{Calculate Median for Each Sample}
\usage{
calculate_median(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing enzyme activity measurements. The first column should be \code{sample} identifiers, and the remaining columns should contain replicate measurements of enzyme activity for each sample.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original data and an additional column \code{median}, which contains the median of the replicate measurements for each sample.
}
\description{
This function calculates the median of replicate measurements for each sample and adds the result as a new column named "median" to the input data frame.
}
\examples{
# Example data frame with samples and replicate measurements
# df <- data.frame(
#   sample = c("S1", "S2", "S3"),
#   rep1 = c(1.2, 0.8, 1.5),
#   rep2 = c(1.1, 0.9, 1.6),
#   rep3 = c(1.3, 0.7, 1.4)
# )
# result <- calculate_median(df)
# print(result)
