\title{Enzyme Ratio Names and Labeller for the log ratios}
\format{
An object of class \code{list} of length 8.
}
\usage{
enzyme_ratio_names2
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{enzyme_ratio_names}: A named list of enzyme ratio abbreviations and their corresponding descriptive names.
\item \code{enzyme_labeller}: A function that returns the appropriate enzyme ratio label for a given value.
}
}
\description{
These functions handle enzyme ratio names and label them in a format suitable for \code{ggplot2} visualizations.
The \code{enzyme_ratio_names} list defines a set of common enzyme ratios and their corresponding display names.
The \code{enzyme_labeller} function retrieves the appropriate label for each enzyme ratio based on its value, which can be used for customizing plots.
